# Fitwell
The all-in-one wellness platform.

Our platform has 2 primary functions:
* To verify the availability of medicines specified by the user in pharmacies near them.
* To deliver medicines to users.

Complex data structures and algorithms will be required to perform these functions, including trees, dictionaries, tree traversal, and search algorithm.

# Installation
To run our program, you must install:
* Python programming language (all version between 3.6 and 3.11).
* Python libraries: requests, maths. To install these libraries, type the following commands:
  * import requests
  * import maths
 
Now that you have installed all the requirements, open the file "Fitwell.py" and run the program.

# The Dataset
The dataset provides information about 67 neighbourhoods in the LA region. Its content is relevant for anyone interested into understanding if a specific district is relevant for their needs. The following variables are presented:
* Name: For each row, it contains the name of the neighbourhood.
* Education Ranking: From 1 to 9 ranking the level of public school education, 1 being the worst and 9 the best.
* Safety Ranking: From 1 to 5, represented the level of neighbourhood safety, being 1 the worst and 5 the best.
* Average House Price: The estimated average housing price.

This dataset was manully constructed by our group taking Google Maps as a source.

# Usage
The user starts by entering their address, including their city and postcode, into the system. The system uses the Nominatim API to convert the entered address into geographical coordinates. The user is then prompted to enter the name of the medicine they need to refill. The PharmacyTree class processes the user input and searches its network of pharmacies to find those that have the specified medicine in stock. For each pharmacy that has the medicine, the system calculates the distance from the user's location using the Haversine formula. The system displays a list of pharmacies where the medicine is available, along with the distance to each pharmacy from the user's location. The system identifies the closest pharmacy with the required medicine and displays its name and distance. The address of the closest pharmacy is then provided to the user. If the address is not available in the system, "Address not found for the closest pharmacy" is displayed. The user can then decide to visit the pharmacy based on the information provided.

Limitations:
1. Scalability: The tree structure for storing pharmacy data may not scale efficiently for a large number of pharmacies, especially when performing operations like searching for the nearest pharmacy.
2. Updating Pharmacy Inventory: There is no mechanism for real-time updates or synchronization of pharmacy inventories, which can lead to outdated information being presented to the user.

# Further Improvements
1. Implement Real-Time Inventory Updates: Enhance the inventory management system to reflect real-time changes in stock levels. This could involve integrating with pharmacy management systems for automatic updates.
2. User Authentication and Profiles: Implement user authentication to manage personal information securely, especially since health information is highly sensitive and confidential. Additionally, user profiles could store medical history, preferences, and recurring prescriptions for a personalized experience.
4. Interface with Healthcare Providers: Develop a system for healthcare providers to input prescriptions directly into the system, ensuring accuracy and reducing manual entry by users.
6. Integration with Delivery Services: Implement a feature for home delivery of medicines, particularly useful for users with mobility issues or in times of public health emergencies.
9. Analytics Dashboard: Develop an analytics dashboard for pharmacies to track demand trends, popular medicines, and user feedback, aiding in better inventory management.

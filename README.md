# Fitwell
The all-in-one wellness platform.

Our platform has 2 primary functions:
* To verify the availability of medicines specified by the user in pharmacies in Segovia.
* To find the nearest pharmacy to the user with the desired medicine in stock.

Complex data structures and algorithms will be required to perform these functions, including trees, dictionaries, tree traversal, and search algorithm.

Watch the following video for more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnMCcCeiTJ0

# Requirements
To run our program, you must install:
* Python programming language (all versions between 3.6 and 3.11).
* Python libraries: requests, maths. To install these libraries, type the following commands:
  * import requests
  * import maths
 
Now that you have installed all the requirements, you can run the program.

Additional information: 
* We have developed this code in the Mac OS operating system.
* Both codes have been designed to run in Python evironments where the following conditions have been met:
  * Python environment (all versions between 3.6 and 3.11).
  * File system access: The code needs to be run in an environment where it has permission to read and write to the file.
  * User input: The code relies on user inputs, so it must be run in an interactive Python environment. 

# Dataset
The dataset includes the name, location, names of the medicines being sold at the pharmacy and their stock level, for each pharmacy in Segovia. This data will be manually inputted by each pharmacy using the program "forPharmacy", which will be written to a CSV file named "pharmacy_data.csv". This allows for real-time updates and synchronisation of pharmacy inventories.

# Usage
The user starts by entering their address, including their city and postcode, into the system. The user is then asked to enter the name of the medicine they need to refill. The PharmacyTree class processes the medicine inputted and searches its network of pharmacies to find those that have the specified medicine in stock. For each pharmacy that currently carries the medicine, the system calculates the distance from the user's location. The system displays a list of pharmacies where the medicine is available, along with the distance to each pharmacy from the user's location. The system identifies the closest pharmacy carrying the medicine and displays its name, distance, and address. If the address is not available in the system, "Address not found for the closest pharmacy" is displayed. The user can then decide whether to visit the pharmacy based on the information provided.

We have also written another code that enables pharmacies to input and update their stock levels in the system, allowing for real-time updates and synchronisation of pharmacy inventories - all information presented to the user is accurate.

Limitations:
1. Scalability: The tree structure for storing pharmacy data will be highly inefficient when the number of pharmacies is high, especially when performing operations such as searching for the nearest pharmacy, which has a running time of O(n).

# File Architecture
* forPharmacy.py: Manages pharmacy and medicine data, inputted by pharmacies themselves.
* forUser.py: Manages user interactions, allowing them to search for the nearest pharamcies that have their desired medicine in stock.

# Further Improvements
1. User Authentication: Implement user authentication to manage highly sensitive and confidential health information.
2. Interface with Healthcare Providers: Develop a system for healthcare providers to input their patients' prescriptions directly into the system, ensuring they are taking the right medicines in the right doses and reducing manual entry by users.
3. Integration with Delivery Services: Implement a feature that delivers medicines to the doorsteps of users in order to increase the accessibility of medicines for everyone, especially for people with limited mobility.
4. Analytics Dashboard: Develop an analytics dashboard for pharmacies to track demand trends for medicines over time, improving inventory management.
5. Error handling: Error handling for user inputs to prevent issues from arising due to invalid or incomplete inputs.
6. Efficiency: Increase the efficiency of the program by using more efficient data structures and algorithms to manage the pharmacy data.
